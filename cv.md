## About myself:
My name is Polina, currently I'm working as a freelance model. I love to learn new things and I'm passionate about new technologist. I want to change my career path and I want to dedicate all my free time leaning at this course in RSSCHOOL. Iâ€™m drawn to the creative aspect of Front-End development. It gives me a chance to solve design and user interaction challenges, allowing me to merge creativity with technical skills. I enjoy finding solutions to create visually appealing, responsive websites that are easy to navigate.
## Code example:  

``` 
function squareDigits(num){
    let str = num.toString();
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++){
        result[i] = str[i] * str[i];
    }
    return Number(result.join(''))
}
```
